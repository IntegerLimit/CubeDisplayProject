# Cube Display Project

A simple, 3D rendering project. Serves two goals:
- Acts as a demo and representation for a hard to illustrate 3D problem
- Acts as practice for my 3D projection skills

The problem resolves around M and N. Find the minimum distance of MN given that ABCD-A'B'C'D' is a cube of side lengths 1.
