# Cube Display Project

A simple 3D rendering project. Just a cube, points, data and distances.

Utilizes [MacroQuad](https://macroquad.rs/) for rendering to screen, matrix and vector calculations, and quaternion calculations.

Has abysmal code quality and optimization.

## Goals
Serves two goals:
- Acts as a demo and representation for a hard to illustrate 3D problem
- Acts as practice for my 3D projection skills

The problem resolves around M and N. Find the minimum distance of MN given that ABCD-A'B'C'D' is a cube of side lengths 1.
